Creating Data Structures
------------------------
**0. Create data structure from microscopy/image file(s)...**

The first step in analysing data with Cell-ACDC is creating a suitable data structure from raw microscopy files. This can be done completely automated using module 0.

To start off, launch the module by pressing on the corresponding button in the main menu.

This will open a window in which you can choose how you want to proceed.

.. note::

    Cell-ACDC can use the Bio-Formats or the AICSlmagelO libraries to read microscopy files.

    Bio-Formats requires Java and a python package called javabridge, that will be automatically installed if missing. We recommend using Bio-Formats, since it can read the metadata of the file, such as pixel size, numerical aperture etc.

    If Bio-Formats fails, try using AICSlmagelO.

    Alternatively, if you already pre-processed your microscopy files into TIF files, you could choose to simply re-structure them into the Cell-ACDC compatible format.

After choosing an option, another window will open prompting you to select what kind of data you want to extract from the raw microscopy file:

* Single microscopy file with one or more positions

* Multiple microscopy files, one for each position

* Multiple microscopy files, one for each channel

* NONE of the above

Please select the appropriate option. Afterwards, you are prompted to create an empty folder in which only the microscopy file(s) are present. After doing so, select "Done". Afterwards, you will be prompted to select this folder. After selecting the destination folder, which by default is the folder you selected in the step before, Cell-ACDC will attempt to load OEM metadata.

After a short wait, a window with the extracted metadata should appear. Make sure to double check all values and **change "Order of Dimensions"** to the appropriate value. To double check if the dimensions are in the correct order, press on the eye icon next to "Channel 0" and use the scrollbars to go through the z coordinate and time coordinate. Once all values are in order, press "Ok". If the values are the same for all positions, feel free to click "Use the above metadata for all the next positions". Note that if you have several files, and you press "Ok" and not one of the two other options, the process will stop after each file, and you need to confirm the metadata again.

Each position is saved in a separate folder. The metadata are stored both in a TXT and SCV file, while the channels are stored in separate TIF files.

.. note:: 
    A computer with sufficient RAM is needed in this step! The required amount is heavily reliant on the size of the project.

    It is good practice to keep the original files for future reference, even though they are not needed in the future steps.

Preparing data for further analysis
-----------------------------------
**1. Launch data prep module…**

Through pressing "Launch data prep module…" in the main menu, the data preparation module can be launched. In this step, a sharp image from a z stack can be selected, and afterwards the images can be automatically aligned in a way that cells stay in one position for time lapse experiments.

The alignment process is done using the function ``skimage.registration.phase_cross_correlation`` from the `scikit-image library <https://scikit-image.org/>`__.

To start off, click "File" in the top ribbon and then select "Open". Select the position folder, for example "Position_1", which you want to start preparing. A pop up will appear which asks you for the channel name. Here you should input the channel on which basis you want to align.

In the next menu, select the desired number of frames and z-slices. Here you can also add another custom field, which will be saved in the metadata table. Later, this will be added as a column to the output table.

Next, go through each frame and select the z-slice which is the sharpest (if your data is 3D).  Using the buttons in the top button row, you can apply the current slice to all future or past frames, as well as apply a gradient from the current frame to the first one.

Alternatively, a projection can be used. This is done through the projection drop down menu in the bottom right.

Next, select "start" from the buttons bar. This will start the alignment process. 

.. note::
    Do this even if you don't have a time lapse experiment, as it allows you to carry on to the next step and won't change the data.

Afterwards, the region of interest (ROI) as well as the background ROI (Bkgr. ROI) can be adjusted. This is done through drag and drop on the edges and resizing on the turquoise rhombuses. Make sure that the ROI covers all cells of interest on all frames and that the Bkgr. ROI is on an area without cells. Once all is set, press the "Cut" button. **This will overwrite the previous files**

.. note::
    If the Bkgr. ROI is not visible, a standard Bkgr. ROI is applied. If you want to have a Bkgr. ROI, press the Bkgr. ROI button. 

Multiple ROIs and Bkgr. ROIs can be added through the corresponding buttons. Right click on one of the frames to show an interaction menu through which you can remove it.

Data such as the selected frame is stored in segmInfo.csv, while aligned.npz stores the alignment data.

Segmentation and tracking
-------------------------
**2. Launch segmentation module…**

This module can be used to segment and track object in your data. A plethora of options are available already, and new ones are added constantly. You can also add your own models, a tutorial for this will be added in the future.

Upon launching the module, you first will be prompted to select a folder. This process is the same as before. Next, like before you are prompted to select a channel which should be used for segmentation.

After a short wait, you are prompted to select the model you want to use for **segmentation**, after which one needs to confirm the parameters for segmentation as well as post processing.

Next, you can select a stop frame if you don't want to segment and track the entire experiment. Lastly, you need to select the model which should be used for tracking. The process now begins, and you can lay back and watch the computer do work for you.

Correcting Tracking and Segmentation Mistakes, Cell Cycle Annotation
--------------------------------------------------------------------
**3. Launching GUI…**

Correcting Tracking and Segmentation Mistakes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first step in using the GUI is to load a file. For this, click on "File" in the top ribbon and select "Load folder". This will open a window which prompts you to select a folder. After selecting the folder containing the information for the position you want to analyse, you will be prompted to select the channel you want to view as well as double check the metadata.

After first loading data, you will notice that the current mode is set to "Viewer". This allows you to freely browse through all images, which can be useful for gaining an overview of the data.

To start editing, change the mode to "Segmentation and Tracking".

* |eraser| "Eraser" and |brush| "Brush" function as you expect.
* |separate| "Separation" can be used to separate two cells which were not segmented properly.
* |EditID| "Edit ID" can be used to change the ID of a cell and mend tracking errors.
* |MergeIDs| "Merge IDs" for merging two IDs if a cell was segmented into two parts.
* |AnnotateAsDead| "Annotate as dead", |ExcludeFromAnalysis| "exclude from analysis", |DeletionRegion| "deletion region" and |DelBorder| "delete all objects touching ROI border" for excluding cells or regions from analysis.
* |Repeat-tracking| "Repeat tracking" and |reinitLastSegm| "repeat segmentation" for repeating the respective processes, which can be used to bring frame in line with previous frames.

Important tips:

* Cells with a thick red contour and thick ID are new cells which were not present in the previous frame.
* Yellow contours with a yellow ID with a question mark show the contours of cells which were present in the previous frame but are missing in the currently viewed frame.
* Most key bindings can be viewed and customized via the menu found in the top ribbon "Settings" menu. Pressing "H" will centre the picture, and double pressing "H" resets zoom.
* Press the middle mouse button to delete a cell ID.
* Right click on any point in the picture to reveal more options. Most importantly, the option to show a duplicate picture. This is useful to both view the contours and the segmentation mask.
* Double tap a binding for a tool to select the "empowered" version, which can draw over any cells. Otherwise, tools only influence the cell on which you start drawing. Pressing shift while drawing with the brush will force a new ID creation.
* You can use the arrow keys to navigate between frames.

Cell Cycle Annotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After correcting all errors, change the mode to "Cell Cycle Analysis". You will be presented with a warning that suggests starting from the first frame, which you usually should heed. Important tools for CC-Ana:
